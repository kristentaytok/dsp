#The sample skewness is more susceptible to outliers, which is why the value is larger than the Pearson Median Skewness. Both skewness values are positive, indicating that the household income distribution is skewed to the right. However, we cannot say much about the skewness in this case without knowing more about the upper bound of the income (i.e., the highest income). Sixty-six percent of households report a taxable income below the mean of $74,279.
