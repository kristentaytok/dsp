CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)
# The pregnancy length Cohen's d was positive, indicating that the mean pregnancy length of first pregnancies was larger than the mean of non-first pregnancies. However, the total weights of the babies had a negative Cohen's d score, showing that babies from non-first pregnancies were larger than babies born during the first pregnancies. However, both of these Cohen's effect sizes were less than 0.1 in magnitude--which is considered a small difference between the two groups.
